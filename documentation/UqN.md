# UqN()

The Jaccard-type overlap quantifies the effective proportion of OTUs or lineages in a system that are shared across all subsystems. Hence, this metric quantifies overlap from the perspective of the overall system. Its corresponding dissimilarity (1 âˆ’ UqN) quantifies the effective proportion of nonshared OTUs or lineages in the overall system. UqN is integrated in the functions beta.dis() and pair.dis().

## Arguments
| Arguments | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| beta | A beta diversity value based on Hill numbers. |
| qvalue | The q value used to compute the beta diversity. It needs to be a positive number, usually between 0 and 5, but most commonly 0, 1 or 2. It can be an integer or contain decimals. |
| N | An integer indicating sample size, the number of sampling units to be used to compute the similarity measure.  |
