#' @description The Jaccard-type overlap quantifies the effective proportion of OTUs or lineages in a system that are shared across all subsystems. Hence, this metric quantifies overlap from the perspective of the overall system. Its corresponding dissimilarity (1 − UqN) quantifies the effective proportion of nonshared OTUs or lineages in the overall system. UqN is integrated in the functions beta.dis() and pair.dis().
#' @param beta A beta diversity value based on Hill numbers.
#' @param qvalue The q value used to compute the beta diversity. It needs to be a positive number, usually between 0 and 5, but most commonly 0, 1 or 2. It can be an integer or contain decimals.
#' @param N An integer indicating sample size, the number of sampling units to be used to compute the similarity measure.
#' @return A Jaccard-type overlap value
